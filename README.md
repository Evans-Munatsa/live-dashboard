# live-dashboard


This is a real-time web analytics dashboard

It is build using these Nodejs,Express.js, socket.io and Vuejs

l learnt this through a tutorial by coligo

to see how it works you just need to clone the repo and do npm install, after you are done just run index.js and open multiple table to see what is going on because it relies on websockets
